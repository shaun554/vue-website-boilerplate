### Run in production

```
Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
### Run in development
Create a `config/development.js` file and match it to `config/production.js` with your values.
```
npm run development
```
Go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
### Config
#### Contact email
Because Nuxt.js doesn't have a mail server, the contact form uses an SMTPS string to connect to your mail server of choice. To do this, add an `SMTPS_STRING` to your ENV vars in your Cosmic JS bucket.  This is located in Your Bucket > Settings > Deploy Website.  An example string looks like: `smtps://yourname%40gmail.com:yourpass@smtp.gmail.com`.
